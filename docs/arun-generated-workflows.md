# Generated CI Workflow Follow-up

ARUN generated the workflow definitions below, but the current GitHub token cannot publish files under `.github/workflows/` without the `workflow` scope. Add these workflow files manually or rerun ARUN with a token that includes `workflow` scope.

## `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
